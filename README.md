# Description
A project using Spark for Intrusion Detection with a 2 feature decision tree algorithm based on network traffic features, utilizing the UNSW-NB15 dataset and databricks.

# Abstract:
In this project we are interested in using Hive for Intrusion Detection using a simple 2 feature decision tree algorithm based on network traffic features. The project will be based on a research project that was done by Nour Moustafa and Jill Slay. During this project, I will use the UNSW-NB15 dataset which is free to use for academic purposes, and this is the case with my project.
Furthermore, my project will be based on two research papers that were published by the contributors of the main research project. As mentioned before, the goal behind this project is using Hive. So, the Hadoop environment will be a docker container that contains all the necessary tools.

# Description of the data set:
The UNSW-NB15 data set was created using an IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Center for Cyber Security to generate a hybrid of the realistic modern normal activities and the synthetic contemporary attack behaviors from network traffic. A tcpdumb tool was used to capture 100 GB of raw network traffic. However, Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 provide a clear idea about the features of the data set and its description.

# Overview of Hadoop architecture used:

I used the same architecture as the previous project. However, in this time I will add new containers to run spark successfully.

### Docker Container:

*Fig 1. Different Component of the Hadoop Architecture used in a Docker Container*

### Docker-Spark: spark-master and spark-worker:

*Fig2: spark master and spark worker*

### NameNode Shell:

`hadoop fs -rm input train_set_schema.hql`

This Hadoop command is used to remove the **train_set_schema.hql** file from the **input** directory

`hadoop fs -ls input`

This Hadoop command is used to list the files and directories present in the **input** directory

`hadoop fs -put UNSW_NB15_training-set2.csv input/`

This Hadoop command is used to upload the **UNSW_NB15_training-set2.csv** file to the **input** directory

### Scala Console:

*Fig4: Scala Console with some code examples*

Since I faced some problems concerning the above architecture, I will switch to another one using Databricks. However, the main point behind this part is to give a general idea of how we can integrate spark with our local Hadoop Architecture.

# Overview of Databricks architecture used:
### What is Databricks:

The Databricks Lakehouse Platform makes it easy to build and execute data pipelines, collaborate on data science and analytics projects and build and deploy machine learning models.

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Spark-Detection-Intrusion/raw/master/Assets/Databricks.png)

*Fig5: Overview of Databricks Solutions

### How to use Databricks:

To make the use of Databricks, especially for academic projects, I recommend you using Databricks Community Edition. The Databricks Community Edition is the **free version of the Databricks’ cloud-based big data platform**. Its users can access a micro-cluster as well as a cluster manager and notebook environment. All users can share their notebooks and host them free of charge with Databricks.

### Clusters Manager:

*Fig 6: The clusters managers of Databricks*

### Databricks Notebooks:

*Fig 8: An Overview of Workspace (Notebooks) Manager*

### Loading the Data:

Using Databricks provides us many data sources that we can use. For instance, we can use S3, DBFS (Databricks Files Systems), or other data sources such as Casandra, Amazon Kinesis… 

For this project, we will work with DBFS.

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Spark-Detection-Intrusion/raw/master/Assets/Databricks%20Data%20Soruce.png)

*Fig 9: Databricks Data Sources*

As I said before, in this project we will use DBFS or Databricks File System. To explain more how it works, Databricks provides Community Edition Users with 15G of storage in its File Systems, and after uploading the files to the File System, an absolute path to the data will be provided. Using that path will guarantee easy access to the data.

*Fig 10: DBFS Overview*

# Building the Schema:

To build a schema for our datasets, there are two ways; either by defining a schema from scratch, or we can use pre-defined function that can do this job for us.

### Defining Schema from Scratch:

Total Records | 175,341 | 82,322

# Computing the Gini Impurity:

n this part, I will calculate the impurity for 5 features because they are the most likely to split our training set. However, the features are:

* is_sm_ips_port
* is_ftp_login
* ct_ftp_cmd
* Service
* ct_state_ttl
* proto

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Spark-Detection-Intrusion/blob/master/Assets/Function%201.png)

*Fig20: Function 1*

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Spark-Detection-Intrusion/blob/master/Assets/Gini%20Impurity%20for%20every%20Feature.png?raw=true)

*Fig21: Calculating Gini Impurity for every Feature*


### The result of Gini impurity:


* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.42**
* Total Gini for service is **0.403**
* Total Gini for ct_state_ttl is **0.158**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.435**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.435**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.352**

As we can see from the above result the **Root Node is ct_state_ttl** because it has the best Gini impurity.

## Computing Gini Impurity for the Next Best Feature to Choose:

used the same process as I did in the previous question. In fact, I used the same functions. However, the following results is after computing Gini Impurity for each split in the Root Node:

### The result of Gini impurity for Root Node ct_state_ttl = 0:

* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.042**
* Total Gini for service is **0.041**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.042**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.042**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.017**

As we can see from the above result the **First Node is proto** because it has the best Gini impurity.

### The result of Gini impurity for Root Node ct_state_ttl = 1:

* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.291**
* Total Gini for service is **0.270**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.290**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.290**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.291**

As we can see from the above result the **Second Node is service** because it has the best Gini impurity.

### The result of Gini impurity for Root Node ct_state_ttl = 2:

* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.065**
* Total Gini for service is **0.117**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.125**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.125**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.063**

As we can see from the above result the **Third Node is proto** because it has the best Gini impurity.

### The result of Gini impurity for Root Node ct_state_ttl = 3:

* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.267**
* Total Gini for service is **0.05**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.257**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.257**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.137**

As we can see from the above result the **Fourth Node is service** because it has the best Gini impurity.

### The result of Gini impurity for Root Node ct_state_ttl = 6:

* Total Gini for is_sm_ips_ports is **0.494**
* Total Gini for service is **0.441**
* Total Gini for is_ftp_login is **0.495**
* Total Gini for ct_ftp_cmd is **0.495**
* Total Gini for proto is **0.009**

As we can see from the above result the **Fifth Node is proto** because it has the best Gini impurity.


### The Decision Tree Schema:

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Hive-Detection-Intrusion/raw/master/Assets/Decision%20Tree%20Schema.png)

*Fig22: Decision Tree Schema After Computing Gini Impurity*

### Example of How this Decision Tree works:

For a certain record in the dataset, we will see first the value of the ct_state_ttl because it is the Root Node. Let's say, for example, ct_state_ttl = 0, then the second split will be in the level of the proto column. If the proto has as a value ‘sctp’, the prediction of the label will be 1. So, this is a simple example of how that decision tree works.

## Predictions and Confusion Matrix:

### Predictions that are produced by the Decision Tree Model for Training:

### Positive Predictions for Training Set:

![alt text](https://github.com/AchrafAjrhourh/Spark-Detection-Intrusion/blob/master/Assets/Positive%20Predictions%20for%20Training%20Set.png?raw=true)

*Fig23: An Example of how to Calculate Positive Predictions for Training Set*

** NOTE: In the above image, I did not provide all the code for calculating the positive predictions. In fact, I showed only one example. The idea is to do the same for each split in the decision tree. **

* Positive Predictions: 129,560
